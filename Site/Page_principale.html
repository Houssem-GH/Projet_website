					<br />
						Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate chemical reactions.<br />
						The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts<br />
						the substrates into different molecules known as products. Almost all metabolic processes<br />
						in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.<br />
						Enzymes ensure the catalyze the steps of metabolic pathways. A metabolic pathway of<br />
						several is composed chemical reactions. A chemical reaction is a process that converts<br />
						one or more substances (known as substrates) to another type of substance (the product).<br />
						As a catalyst, an enzyme can facilitate the same chemical reaction over and over again.<br />
