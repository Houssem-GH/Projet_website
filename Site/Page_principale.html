		Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts.Enzymes accelerate chemical reactions. 
		The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts the substrates 
		into different molecules known as products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough 
		to sustain life. Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps. The study of enzymes is called enzymology and 
		a new field of pseudoenzyme analysis has recently grown up, recognising that during evolution, some enzymes have lost the ability to carry out 
		biological catalysis, which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences and unusual 'pseudocatalytic' properties.<br />
