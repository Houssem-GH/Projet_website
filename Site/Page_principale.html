					Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate chemical reactions.<br />  
					The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts <br />
					the substrates into different molecules known as products. Almost all metabolic processes<br />
					in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.<br />
					Enzymes ensure the catalyze the steps of metabolic pathways. A metabolic pathway is <br /> 
					composed of several chemical reactions. A chemical reaction is a process thatconverts <br /> 
					one or more substances (known as substrates) to another type of substance (the product).<br /> 
					As a catalyst, an enzyme can facilitate the same chemical reaction over and over again.<br />
